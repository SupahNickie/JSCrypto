JSCrypto
========

This Javascript-based app is designed to reinforce our prowess with JS and introduces JS testing to us. The encoder.html page will take any message that you want to be encoded and run it through the Google cryptography API, returning a cipher-text version of the message that's dynamically generated. The user then copy/pastes that into the URL bar, thus opening the decoder.html page, which runs the same processes backwards, thus decoding the string when given the proper password.

Jasmine is used to test the various JS functions and passes with the expected results based on the variables we declared inside the specs.
